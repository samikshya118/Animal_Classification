# 🐾 Animal Image Classification  

This project builds a **deep learning model** to classify animal images into predefined categories.  
It uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to automatically extract visual features and predict the correct class with high accuracy.

---

## 🔎 Overview  
Image classification is a core computer vision task with applications in wildlife monitoring, species recognition, and automated tagging.  
This project aims to develop a robust model that can handle variations in lighting, background, and pose.

---

## 📝 Problem Statement  
- Classify animal images into their correct categories.  
- Handle variability in input data for reliable performance.  
- Evaluate multiple architectures to find the best model.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Collect and preprocess a labeled dataset of animal images.  
- Apply **data augmentation** (resize, normalize, flip, rotate, zoom) to improve model generalization.  
- Train a CNN to learn feature representations and classify images.  
- Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

---

## 📊 Dataset  
- **Source:** Public datasets (Kaggle’s Animals-10 / CIFAR-10 subset) or custom dataset.  
- **Classes:** Multiple animal categories (e.g., cat, dog, elephant, lion, etc.).  
- **Preprocessing:** Images resized (e.g., 128×128 px) and normalized.  
- **Split:** Train, validation, and test sets for robust evaluation.

## ⚙️ Methodology  

### 🔧 Data Preprocessing  
- Resize and normalize pixel values to `[0, 1]`.  
- Apply random flips, rotations, brightness/zoom shifts.  
- Split data into train, validation, and test sets.  

### 🧠 Model Development  
- Build a CNN with convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.  
- Use ReLU activation and softmax for classification.  
- Optimize with Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.  

### 📊 Model Evaluation  
- Track training/validation accuracy and loss.  
- Evaluate on test set using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- Visualize confusion matrix to spot misclassifications.

## 📈 Results  
- Achieved **high classification accuracy** on test data.  
- Data augmentation improved robustness and reduced overfitting.  
- Model performed well even on unseen images with different poses/backgrounds.

---

## 💡 Insights  
- Larger dataset size improved performance significantly.  
- CNNs outperformed traditional ML models (SVM, KNN) on image data.  
- Most errors occurred between visually similar species.

## 🚀 Future Work  
- Use **transfer learning** with pretrained models (ResNet, MobileNet) for better accuracy.  
- Expand to **multi-label classification** for images with multiple animals.  
- Integrate **object detection models** (YOLO, Faster R-CNN) for bounding box predictions.  
- Deploy as a **web or mobile app** for real-time classification.
